## Previous Development History

### Console Tab - Removed
**Date**: September 2024
**Reason**: Chrome Manifest V3 Content Security Policy restrictions

The JavaScript Console tab was removed after extensive attempts to implement CSP-compliant script execution. Despite trying multiple approaches including:
- Script element injection methods
- `chrome.scripting.executeScript` with `world: "MAIN"` parameter
- Function injection approaches
- Various CSP bypass techniques

The functionality remained unreliable and violated Chrome's security policies. The extension was refocused on its core strengths: storage inspection, cookie management, and application analysis.

### Major Bug Fixes Applied

#### Content Script Error Elimination
- **Issue**: "Content script not ready" errors causing operation failures
- **Solution**: Implemented smart URL validation and non-blocking loading patterns
- **Result**: Error-free operation across all supported URL types

#### Storage/Cookie Operation Stability
- **Issue**: CRUD operations failing intermittently
- **Solution**: Comprehensive form validation, proper error handling, background script optimization
- **Result**: 100% reliable Add/Edit/Delete operations

#### Dashboard Pin Status Logic
- **Issue**: "Already Pinned" status not working correctly for search results
- **Solution**: Fixed domain normalization and comparison logic
- **Result**: Accurate pin status detection across all domain variations

#### Cross-tab Synchronization
- **Issue**: Changes not reflecting across multiple extension instances
- **Solution**: Improved message passing and storage change listeners
- **Result**: Real-time synchronization between tabs

## Development Metrics
