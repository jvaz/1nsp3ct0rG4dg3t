## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL TASKS REQUIRING MANUAL COMPLETION

### 1. Fix Icon Sizes (CRITICAL - WILL CAUSE REJECTION)

**Current Issue**: All icon files are 1024x1024 pixels instead of their declared sizes
**Required Action**: Resize icons to correct dimensions using image editing software

```bash
# Current files (all are 1024x1024 - WRONG):
assets/icons/icon16.png  -> Must be 16x16 pixels
assets/icons/icon32.png  -> Must be 32x32 pixels
assets/icons/icon48.png  -> Must be 48x48 pixels
assets/icons/icon128.png -> Must be 128x128 pixels
```

**How to Fix**:
1. Use image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, online tools)
2. Resize each icon to exact dimensions
3. Maintain quality and ensure readability at small sizes
4. Update both `assets/icons/` and `dist/assets/icons/` directories

### 2. Remove Console.log Statements from Production Build

**Current Issue**: Found console.log statements in production files
**Files Affected**:
- dist/background.js
- dist/content-script.js
- dist/panel.js

**How to Fix**:
```bash
# Option 1: Clean source files and rebuild
1. Remove console.log statements from src/ files
2. Run: npm run build

# Option 2: Configure webpack to strip console.logs in production
# Add to webpack.config.js:
optimization: {
  minimize: true,
  minimizer: [
    new TerserPlugin({
      terserOptions: {
        compress: {
          drop_console: true
        }
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

### 3. Create Screenshots for Chrome Web Store

**Required**: 5 screenshots at 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels

**Screenshot Plan**:
1. **Dashboard Tab**: Show pinned properties with different data types
2. **Storage Tab**: Display localStorage/sessionStorage with JSON viewer open
3. **Cookie Tab**: Show cookie management with security analysis
4. **Application Tab**: Display performance metrics and framework detection
5. **Side Panel Overview**: Show extension integrated in Chrome's side panel

**Tools Needed**:
- Chrome browser with extension loaded
- Screenshot tool (Chrome DevTools, OS screenshot tool, or extension)
- Image editor for resizing/cropping to exact dimensions
