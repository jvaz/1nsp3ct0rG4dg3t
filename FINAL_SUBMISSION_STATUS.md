```
assets/icons/icon16.png  -> Resize to 16x16 pixels
assets/icons/icon32.png  -> Resize to 32x32 pixels
assets/icons/icon48.png  -> Resize to 48x48 pixels
assets/icons/icon128.png -> Resize to 128x128 pixels
```

**Tools**: Use any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, online tools)
**Time**: ~30 minutes

### 2. Create Store Screenshots (Required for Good Presentation)
**Needed**: 5 screenshots at 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels

**Screenshot Plan**:
1. Dashboard with pinned properties
2. Storage management with JSON viewer
3. Cookie management with security analysis
4. Application inspector with metrics
5. Side panel integration overview

**Time**: ~1 hour
